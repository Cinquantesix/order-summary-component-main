## My process

What I want to try in this challenge before to begin with junior stuff:

- Make a better HTML (less div, more relevant tag)
- Use BEM or anything apparent
- Try use less grid and more flexbox and be able to make the good choice between these two sibling
- Use more variable in SCSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS

### What I learned

I learn a lot between Grid en Flexbox but also how to use firefox inspector. It really help to see and understand these two. I also try a new way to add mediaqueries in my SCSS which I don't think it will be the better way to add in a big project. But anyway, I learn it so maybe it will help someday!

### Continued development

Now I wan't to step up and try the Junior challenge with more JS and Maybe add SCSS mixin. I also want' to developp with more tools like CMS and why note REACT or anything else.
